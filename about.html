    <h5>Hello!</h5>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        My name is Linnea Wolniewicz and I am a Computer Science Ph.D. Student at the University of Hawaiʻi (UH) at Mānoa researching how we can use scientific domain knowledge to inform our machine learning models.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        I am a part of Dr. Peter Sadowski's machine learning lab in the Information and Computer Science department at UH Mānoa.
        My research is in part funded by the National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship (Grant No. 2236415). 
        I received my M.Sc. from the UH Mānoa in Computer Science in August 2024 and my B.A. from the University of Colorado Boulder in Astrophysics in May 2022.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> 
        I am interested in using physics-informed machine learning to solve scientific problems, specifically in the context of astronomy, or more broadly AI for science.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        I am also passionate about outreach, and serve as the Vice President and Outreach Coordinator of Graduate Women in Science Hawaiʻi. I organize exoplanet discovery workshops at High Schools around the state of Hawaiʻi to encourage young women to pursue careers in STEM.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        In my free time I can be found climbing, hiking, or surfing the waves of Oʻahu. 
        I have also studied the harp since I was eight years old, and enjoy playing with orchestras when I have the chance.
