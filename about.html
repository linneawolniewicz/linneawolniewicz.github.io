<h3>Hello!</h3>

<p>
    My name is Linnea Wolniewicz, and I am passionate about using machine learning to understand the universe around us.
    I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student in Dr. Peter Sadowski's Machine Learning Lab at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa and a National Science Foundation Fellow.
    I received my M.Sc. from UH Mānoa in Computer Science in August, 2024 and my B.A. from the University of Colorado Boulder in Astrophysics in May, 2022.
    I am interested in using scientific domain knowledge to inform machine learning models, or more broadly AI for science. 
    In my free time I can be found playing the harp (in which I minored in in college), or surfing and hiking in Hawai'i.
