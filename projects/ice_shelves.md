summary: "Automatically detecting events in Antarctic ice shelves"

I conducted this work as an Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) student at MIT's Haystack Observatory in 2021.

In this project, I created a data pipeline to prepare Antarctic seismic data for machine learning. I applied a Gaussian mixture model and convolutional neural network to automatically detect ocean wave events in Antarcticaâ€™s Ross Ice Shelf.
