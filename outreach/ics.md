summary: "Organizing events, funding, and a communal space for ICS graduate students"
---

My co-chair and I regularly apply for university funding to organize weekly Coffee Hours for graduate students and faculty to foster community within the Information and Computer Science (ICS) department at UH MƒÅnoa. We also organize and maintain a communal space for graduate students to engage with each other.

I also served as the ICS Graduate Student Representative to the Graduate Student Organization (GSO) from August 2022 to August 2024. I held this role within [GSO](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/graduate/graduate-student-organization/) to develop a healthy environment for ICS graduate students, communicate graduate student needs with UH administration, and award funding to ICS graduate students.
