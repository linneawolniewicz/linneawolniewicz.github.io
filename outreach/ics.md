summary: "Organizing events and funding for ICS graduate students"
---

I organize for university funding to organize weekly Coffee Hours for graduate students and faculty to build community within the Information and Computer Science (ICS) department at UH MƒÅnoa.

I also served as the ICS Graduate Student Representative to the Graduate Student Organization (GSO) from August 2022 to August 2024. I held this role within [GSO](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/graduate/graduate-student-organization/) to develop a healthy environment for ICS graduate students, communicate graduate student needs with UH administration, and award funding to ICS graduate students.
