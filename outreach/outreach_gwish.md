summary: "Outreach with Graduate Women in Science Hawaiʻi"
---

I am the Vice President and Outreach Coordinator for Graduate Women in Science Hawaiʻi, an organization that focuses on outreach to increase the participation of women in STEM. I lead workshops at high schools around Hawaiʻi with only female graduate student volunteers, to encourage young women to participate in STEM and connect them with mentors. This work is funded by a Catalyst for Science Advancement award (award number: 223C) under NASA's ICE-Five-0 grant.
