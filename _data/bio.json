// 2nd year PhD Student in Computer Science at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa researching how we can use science to inform our machine learning models.
// I am a part of Dr. Peter Sadowski's machine learning lab in the Information and Computer Science department at UH Mānoa. My research is in part funded by the National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship (Grant No. 2236415). My focus is on using scientific domain knowledge to inform machine learning models, specifically in the context of astronomy.

// I will recieve my Masters in Computer Science from the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa in the summer of 2024, and received my B.A. in Astrophysics from the University of Colorado Boulder in May 2022.

// In my free time, I enjoy climbing, surfing, and hiking. I also received a Minor in Harp Performance at CU Boulder and enjoy playing my harp with university and community orchestras.

// I am also the Outreach Coordinator of Graduate Women in Science Hawaiʻi, and during this role I have organized the outreach program "Exploring Beyond: Inspiring Future Planetary Explorer-Scientists" which involves hosting exoplanet discovery workshops at High Schools around the state of Hawaiʻi and encouraging girls to pursue careers in STEM.
